# Twitter_data_analysis
The following is the solution for TASK- A as per directions shared.
The repository contains following files:
1. twitter_streaming.py- in which we are trying to fetch twitter tweets for 'arvind kejriwal' and 'narender modi' using tweepy and storing in twitter_data json file.
2. mongo.py- file code for converting json file data to mongodb database
3. Plot_one.py- to plot visualization graph
4.twitter_data- the json file containing colected data from twitter
5. twitter_streaming1.py- I have tried to combine the code of fetching twitter data and storing in mongodb database togeter in one script rather than seprate scripts.
